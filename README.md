### About The Notebook

This notebook acted as my submission for the final task of DPhi's the deep learning bootcamp organised . The bootcamp consisted of 100+ hours of coursework, live sessions from
industry experts, quizzes, and projects/datathons on real-world image data.

This notebook was marked as one of the best submissions for the assignment/datathon.
Link to all the best submissions: https://github.com/dphi-official/Deep_Learning_Bootcamp/tree/master/Assignment2_Best_Notebooks/Best_Notebooks_Intermediate

The well documented notebook consists of 3 models: A Multilayer Perceptron, A CNN and A Deep Transferred Learning Model (using VGG16). It consists of multiple ways to load the data and pre-proscess the data and can act as a great guide for beginneres.
